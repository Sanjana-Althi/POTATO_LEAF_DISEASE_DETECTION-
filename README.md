# Potato_leaf_disease_detection🍀
## Overview

The **Potato Leaf Disease Detection** app is a deep learning-based solution that classifies potato leaves into **Healthy**, **Early Blight**, and **Late Blight** categories. It helps farmers and researchers identify diseases early, improving crop management.

## Features

-->**Automated Disease Detection** using deep learning
-->**High Accuracy** with real-time classification
-->**Image Preprocessing** for improved model performance
--> **Web/Mobile Deployment** support for easy access
## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / PyTorch
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV
- **Deployment:** Streamlit

## Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repo:
   
   git clonehttps://github.com/Sanjana-Althi/.git
   cd Potato_Leaf_Disease_Detection
   

2. Install dependencies:
 
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

3. Run the app (Streamlit):
 
   streamlit run web.py

## Dataset

The model is trained on the **PlantVillage Potato Leaf Dataset**, containing labeled images of healthy and diseased potato leaves.

## Results
